1.Fix a Git detached head

$git checkout –b temp #makes a new branch from current detached HEAD
$git branch –f master temp #update master to point to the new <temp> branch
$git branch –d temp #delete the <temp> branch
$git push origin master #push the re-established history



2.You have not concluded your merge (MERGE_HEAD exists)

OK. The problem is your previous pull failed to merge automatically and went to conflict state. And the conflict wasn't resolved properly before the next pull.

1) Undo the merge and pull again.

To undo a merge:

git merge --abort [Since git version 1.7.4]

git reset --merge [prior git versions]

2) Resolve the conflict.  // 解决冲突后提交、解决冲突可以在解决直接修改，但需要全部resolve才可以

3) Don't forget to add and commit the merge.

4) git pull now should work fine.
